<p>
I like to write text scores for specific people in a specific performance context. 
  Most times this has happened, there's been between zero and one rehearsal, but the thing often still comes out cool.
</p>


  <p>The best documented one is <a href="https://eatingitcauseitsthere.com/text-scores/HOT-AIR-LIQUID-SLEEP-SUSPENDED-ANIMATION-BREAKAGE-BLOOM.rtf">this</a> one, 
    the video for which is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gflH66H0roLMyc0RaN8E4F3KAAbyE8gU/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.  We got to run-through this one before showtime, which was nice.
  There was an error with the audio recording, so the sound on the video is a little wonky. 
  I made this at the Creative Music Intensive at Arts Letters and Numbers in 2024, so huge thanks to everyone there.</p>

  <p> I did a few more text scores there, notably <a href="https://eatingitcauseitsthere.com/text-scores/red-dinner-couch-sawing-score.rtf">this</a> one in which I tried to chainsaw a couch apart (it didn't fully work but I did rip it up with my hands a little),
  <a href="https://eatingitcauseitsthere.com/text-scores/text-score-1.rtf">this</a> one I wrote in an hour on the first day, and <a href="https://eatingitcauseitsthere.com/text-scores/warpage.rtf">this</a> one I wrote with Sarah Bouchard in which I'm playing an upside-down bicycle.  
    Theres a few clips people took from them <a href="https://youtu.be/Br8TxRLVgb0">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QQ-AiN5t0s">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p> I also did some text and some clarinet for a Janet Xmas performance in St Louis, there's a little video <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y2DjCzjYUvbTyAUt5FnblZdoEdQ6Fn13/preview"> here </a>.
  The text is <a href="https://eatingitcauseitsthere.com/text-scores/kerr-foundation-aug-30-2024.rtf">here</a>.</p>

  <p> A favorite of mine is <a href="https://eatingitcauseitsthere.com/text-scores/kimchi-piece.rtf">this</a> comedy piece, there's audio of one rendition <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LAJcaOrUl79uj-WJ43JkB67FiSqx6VsP/view">here</a>.</p>

  <p>My most active performance group is called Rhymes With Orange, which is linked from my <a href="https://eatingitcauseitsthere.com">homepage</a>. 
    I also have a project called Ploosheneploosh with my friend Santiago Gutierrez, which is tragically poorly documented.</p>
