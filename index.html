<p>Welcome to Eating It Cause It's There, a thing that you probably shouldn't do, but it's okay to do it sometimes, I sometimes do it. It's also the name of my artist website.</p>

<p>Here's some other stuff I do:</p>

<p>
I've been getting into <a href = "https://eatingitcauseitsthere.com/performance-art.html">performance art</a>,
</p>

<p>
Most notably with Rhymes With Orange, an absurdist theatre/existential play group that you should check out:  <a href = "https://rhymeswithorange.xyz/">http://rhymeswithorange.xyz/</a>
</p>
  
<p>
I've been working on some singer-songwriter stuff <a href = "https://on.soundcloud.com/SR6G8kAePhctfBpS9">https://on.soundcloud.com/SR6G8kAePhctfBpS9</a>
</p>

  
<p>
Devuroasts and I have a podcast called Hello If Anything that sits between ASMR and improv comedy:  <a href = "https://www.patreon.com/collection/697994">patreon.com/HelloIfAnything</a>
</p>
  
<p>
You Want Milk is a rock band I've been in for a while: <a href = "http://youwantmilk.bandcamp.com/">http://youwantmilk.bandcamp.com/</a>
  I'm a little more proud of this <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p9Pfr6ViweMElvvpbt9AgXYqk-HOlCyJ/view?usp=drive_link">unreleased song</a> than the stuff that's out there.
</p>

<p>
Some of them don't really have much documentation yet, but there's at least a little taste for each one!
I'm also involved in organizing for <a href="https://www.jetlagfestival.com/">JetLAG</a> Festival, mostly booking bands.
</p>

<p>
Plus some other miscellaneous stuff, I wrote a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/3d2bgak8t7b5mrqlv02xz/AFZZfEsInxPuEEhihD7wt60/Bergamot%20Composers%20Concert?preview=Bergamot+-+Matt.wav&rlkey=ar8wb3fyw4t8r3xv0msbe6mnl&subfolder_nav_tracking=1&st=hibgbjub&dl=0">string quartet piece</a> one time that Bergamot Quartet performed and I made this <a href="https://youtu.be/ZdiIUAFg-Go">stop motion</a> with my friend Ledah.
</p>

  <p>
I've also collected documentation of some older work <a href="https://eatingitcauseitsthere.com/older-work.html"> here</a>.
  </p>
<p>
Here's a <a href="https://eatingitcauseitsthere.com/images/creepy-pic.jpeg">weird-lookin pic</a> of me next to a strange stuffed animal on the street at night.
