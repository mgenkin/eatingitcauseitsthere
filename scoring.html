<p>I'm Matt Genkin, Brooklyn-based artist, and if you're reading this, then I or someone else has informed you that I am looking for audio-related work.  
<br>  This could be scoring, editing, recording, mixing & mastering, or anything in between.  
<br>  Here's some examples of my work, all of it is in a DIY setting.
</p>

<p>
I make my own lo-fi mumblecore podcast:

</p>

<p>
I've scored some DIY comedy movies:

</p>

<p>
Also some DIY video art:

</p>

<p>
And I've self-produced some music:

<br>  https://youwantmilk.bandcamp.com
<br>  https://tapestrygirl.bandcamp.com
</p>



<p>
  I've also done lots of mixing for my old DIY venue, The Terrarium, so I can plug some XLRs and ride some EQ knobs at a live event.
