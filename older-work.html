  <p>This is older work that I'm no longer actively developing.  For current work, check out my <a href="https://eatingitcauseitsthere.com">homepage</a>.
  </p>

<p> I helped host a site-specific evening of performances at Fort Tilden called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9WX3tgs7bR/">Strandlines: Fort Tilden</a>.  There's a bunch of videos from that evening <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-61vHCo93rFsafLkcKEvuCD5ZuGw1KVk">here</a>.  It was awesome, full moon and everything.
  I kinda hope it becomes a series but we don't have another one planned yet.

<p>
  I've been in lots of bands over the years.  In reverse chronological order, there was <a href="https://hewhounderstandsbaboon.bandcamp.com/">He Who Understands Baboon</a>,
  <a href="https://tapestrygirl.bandcamp.com/">Tapestry Girl</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hausdorffofficial/sets/hausdorff-at-house-of-brews-2017"> Hausdorff </a>,...
  I'll spare you the high school & middle school bands.
</p>

  <p> I make these <a href="https://mattgenkin.bandcamp.com/album/mr-mangosteen">tracks</a> annually for different events and to reflect on my life.  I intend to continue, but I skipped 2023 so I'm considering it inactive for now.</p>

  <p> For about 3 years I ran a basement venue in Bushwick called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_terrarium_bk/">The Terrarium </a> with a rotating cast of friends.  A lot of beautiful things happened there and I really miss it.  I hope I get to do something like it soon.</p>

  <p> I also started an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CaDShuplu0u/">open mic</a> at beloved Bushwick coffeehouse <a href="https://www.instagram.com/caffeineunderground/">Caffeine Underground</a>.  I'm no longer involved, but my friend Noah is still running <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thehauntedmic/">it</a>!</p>

  <p> During the pandemic, I hosted a DIY livestream festival that features performances from around the country.  There were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clfkMGU4I2E">two</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz3BuVuVt4Y">days</a> of stream.</p>

  <p> I was in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@towntalk804">sketch comedy</a> group for a little while.</p>

  <p> I've also tried stand-up comedy (link coming) a few times, though I've never been very good. </p>

  <p> In college I was more into math & technology, I made this <a href="https://mgenkin.github.io/fractal_pictures/">fractal toy</a> that still works.  
  I made some Java software for visualizing geodesics on hyperbolic surfaces, which is on my github.  I had some other cool Processing sketches and
  a ramshackle livecoding VJ software that I used to do visuals for a rock show, which I can dig up if anyone wants me to.
  But this is getting really far back in time now so I think it's a good place to stop.  Thanks for your interest!
