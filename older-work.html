  <p>This is older work that I'm no longer actively developing.  For current work, check out my <a href="https://eatingitcauseitsthere.com">homepage</a>.

  I've been in lots of bands over the years.  In reverse chronological order, there was <a href="https://hewhounderstandsbaboon.bandcamp.com/">He Who Understands Baboon</a>,
  <a href="https://tapestrygirl.bandcamp.com/">Tapestry Girl</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hausdorffofficial/sets/hausdorff-at-house-of-brews-2017"> Hausdorff </a>,...
  I'll spare you the high school & middle school bands.
</p>

  <p> I make these <a href="https://advancedsystems.bandcamp.com/album/mr-mangosteen">tracks</a> annually for different events and to reflect on my life.  I intend to continue, but I skipped 2023 so I'm considering it inactive for now.</p>

  <p> For about 3 years I and a rotating cast of friends ran a basement venue in Bushwick called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_terrarium_bk/">The Terrarium </a>.  A lot of beautiful things happened there and I really miss it.  I hope I get to do something like it soon.</p>

  <p> I also started an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CaDShuplu0u/">open mic</a> at beloved Bushwick coffeehouse <a href="https://www.instagram.com/caffeineunderground/">Caffeine Underground</a>.  I'm no longer involved, but my friend Noah is still running <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thehauntedmic/">it</a>!</p>
